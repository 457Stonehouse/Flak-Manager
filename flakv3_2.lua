Script: flakv3_2.lua
Author: Stonehouse of RAAF No457 vSQD
Date: 14/11/2014
Prerequisites: 
*Mistv3.3a or higher must be loaded prior to this script being used.
*The script must be loaded prior to any of the functions being run. ie ensure that Mist and this script is loaded before any flak is triggered
*Load on a MISSION START trigger using DO SCRIPT FILE 

Update log:
v0.3 - 	Initial release
v0.4 - 	Tweaks to skill based errors to better balance lethality of flak batteries.
v0.5 - 	Further tweaks to accuracy and rof, incorporated the old fill and attack functions from the vector flak version, renamed to flakv2_0.lua
v2.1 - 	Change to using spherical zones for tof flak and vecflak as the battery is assumed to be at the centre of the zone and using a cylinder as in earlier versions 
		meant attacks occurred on aircraft that are actually out of range. As the mist function getUnitsInZone takes land height into account for spherical zones
		it means that the radius of the zone becomes the max effective range for the battery and only min altitude needs to be checked. Additionally create a version of addtgt and vecflak that can be 
		associated with a moving battery to simulate naval AAA using mist function getUnitsInMovingZones. Correct Flak41 suggested rates of fire.
v3.0	Add proper rate of fire control and number of batteries/flak guns (which equates to number of targets 
		can be engaged at once). 
v3.1 	Tweaked explosion strength,rof and errors for skill
v3.2 	Add helicopters as possible flak targets
		
Overview:
Simulation of a 88mm flak 36/18 battery based on conversations between Stonehouse, Sithspawn and GGTharos in this thread http://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=121894
using time of flight of the shell and the known position and vector of a target aircraft to predict a future position at which to create a box of flak bursts as well as 
when it should happen. 

An average 88mm flak battery consists of 4 guns linked to a and fire control and analogue targeting data computer (TDC). This computer would track targets and provide elevation, range and bearing 
information to the individual guns corrected for their position relative to the TDC. The muzzle velocity of a Flak 88 was around 820 m/s and the rate of fire for a gun crew was between 15 and 25 rounds per minute
depending on the skill and experience of the crew. 6 batteries formed a flak regiment of 24 guns. The individual accuracy of a gun was very high if the TDC crew provided good firing solutions.
To keep things sensible I've made the vecflak and movvecflak functions simulate individual guns - I suggest these are used to simulate flak from maritime units or lightly defended zones. The minimum number of guns is 1 and the maximum is 24. 
Note that 24 flak guns is a flak regiment and anything more than 4-6 guns I suggest is better simulated by the addtgt and movaddtgt functions which simulate batteries of flak guns - groups of 4 guns.
I may reduce the upper limit of 24 to something much lower in future versions if it seems like the 24 guns setting is causing problems.
The addtgt and movaddtgt functions allow you to enter between 1 and 6 batteries. Each battery is 4 guns so again this works out to a single flak regiment. My intention being that a single trigger 
action supports at most a single flak regiment. My reasoning for this is that the skill level is applied at the function call and while I could see an entire green flak regiment being 'low' skill I don't believe it should 
cover more than that. 

This set of scripts assigns an average skill the level of the function call and applies to gun crews and TDC crew, the skill levels are high, med or low. So if I call the vecflak or movvecflak with 2 guns on a single trigger action 
then both guns will get the skill assigned in the function call. Likewise if I called the addtgt or movaddtgt functions with 3 batteries then all 3 batteries will get the same skill.

Some assumptions are made on accuracy based on this skill and these are presented by a random circle of error in altitude, north and east target position prediction. 
Similarly the rate of fire is affected by this skill and should approximate low skill crews achieving 15 rounds per minute (1 shot every 4 secs), medium skill crews 20 rounds per minute 
(1 shot every 3 secs) while a high skill crew will achieve approximately 25 rounds per minute (which I've taken as 1 shot every 2 secs). Note that I have introduced a slight randomness in this rate of 
fire at the individual gun or battery level which will randomly give a gun a slightly better or worse reload rate on the next shot. This stops a synchronised "wave" of flak bursts and instead you get slight variations
on each shot that you would expect in real crews.

Note the Flak41 model which was introduced in 1943 and served mostly in Germany had a muzzle velocity of 1000m/s, rof 20-25 rounds per minute
and an effective ceiling of 10675m (reference http://forum.armyairforces.com/88mm-Antiaircraft-guns-a-potent-weapon-against-USAAF-formations-m182739.aspx and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_Flak_18/36/37/41#Second_generation:_Flak_41) In order to simulate this weapon do the following:
* change _maxAlt to 10675
* change _muzvel to 1000
* change _shotRate to 3 for low skill, _lowShot to 0 and _hiShot to 1
* change _shotRate to 2 for med skill, _lowShot to -1 and _hiShot to 1
* change _shotRate to 2 for high skill, _lowShot to -1 and _hiShot to 0
* trigger zones should be 10675m radius.

Note The fill function is very closely based on the original script authored by SithSpawn with minor tweaks to 
add altitude and damage limits by Stonehouse and all credit and acknowledgment should be given to 
SithSpawn for this function which creates random flak bursts in a zone every second. 

The vecflak & movvecflak function is based on the idea of using the target's velocity vector to create a "tracking" algorithm 
to loosely simulate flak guns trying to track targets and calculate a lead firing solution for them and 
attempting to incorporate an average crew skill to control shot accuracy, spread and rate of fire

The addtgt & movaddtgt functions calculate a predicted target point for each engaged target and writes the co-ordinates and a time the burst should happen to a table. The flakmgr function reads this 
table and if a burst should be created at the current time it will create the explosions as a box of 4 around the target co-ordinates. The error governing the dispersion of this box is given
by the skill level of the batteries involved as is the rate of fire. The addtgt, movaddtgt and flak mgr form a system that creates and manages flak explosions over the entire map.

The addtgt and vecflak scripts require a trigger zone to be placed in the mission editor and the radius of the zone becomes the maximum effective range of the flak. Therefore for Flak 36s this
should be 8000m radius zones. These zones are now treated as spheres so that target slant range is correctly evaluated whereas earlier versions of the script used cylindrical zones and targets
were invalidly attacked at times.

Note that the script no longer scales the flak bursts for each target and each gun or battery will target a single aircraft. So if you said in an addtgt or movaddtgt there are 6 batteries 
then even if there are 10 targets only 6 will be attacked. Likewise the number of guns in the vecflak and movvecflak. 

Usage of time of flight based flak:
* Mission start trigger to load Mist and then this script using DO SCRIPT FILE, note Mist MUST BE LOADED BEFORE this script
* A continuously evaluated trigger with no conditions to run the flakmgr function. The flakmgr function is run with a DO SCRIPT and the entry DO flakmgr() END
* A continuously evaluated trigger with a condition that is true when a target exists in the trigger zone associated with this trigger 
  to run the addtgt function. Each zone can have one or more instances of addtgt where each instance simulates a number of flak batteries of a given skill defending the trigger zone
  depending on how heavily defended the area was. The flak generated is quite deadly so be careful how many batteries are attached to a single zone or exist in  
  overlapping zones. The addtgt function is run with a DO SCRIPT and the entry DO addtgt('side','zone','skill', number of batteries) END, where red or blue would substitute for 
  the word side, the name of the associated zone would substitute (exactly) for the word zone and high, med or low would substitute for the word skill and a integer between 1 and 6 substitutes for number of batteries.
  eg: DO addtgt('blue','redflak1','high',3) END  
* The trigger zone for the addtgt functions should be 8000m in radius as this was the effective range of a Flak36 or 10675 if using Flak41s.
* You can have as many trigger zones for areas defended by flak as you wish within the limits of what you judge is satisfactory performance for DCS World. 
* For the movaddtgt function you do roughly the same thing BUT you do not place a trigger zone and instead a unit name (not a group name) of a unit on the map is passed to the function so the trigger action 
  might look like DO movaddtgt('blue','Unit #01','high',2) This gives 2 BATTERIES of flak guns to Unit #01 allowing up to 2 targets to be engaged each cycle. The flak zone around the unit is a "virtual" one
  and has the radius of _maxAlt. Things like ships make good units for movaddtgt and you would want to add a condition of the unit being alive on the continuous trigger.
   
Usage of fill based flak:
Create a trigger zone with a unique name to represent the flak battery zone of fire and if desired create smaller zones 
within this main trigger zone over towns, airfields etc. so that you use the main trigger zone for the condition to control
the start of the flak bursts and the smaller zones to get the right volume of fire to suit how you want it to look.
Then for the trigger actions add a DO SCRIPT for each smaller zone that executes DO flak.fill('XXXX') END where XXXX 
is the name of the small trigger zone/s. While the flak generated by the fill function is deadly if it hits this function is largely 
meant to give the effect of a flak barrage without the danger. The larger the number of small zones the denser the flak "effect".

Usage of the vector based flak function:
Create a trigger zone with a unique name to represent the flak battery zone of fire
For trigger zone create a continuous trigger with at least a condition like "part of coalition red/blue in zone" 
and then for the trigger actions add a DO SCRIPT that executes DO vecflak('SSSS','YYYY','KKKK',n) END where SSSS is either red or 
blue according to which side is to be attacked by the flak, YYYY is the name of the main zone and KKKK is either low, med or high according to the skill of the flak and 
n is the number of guns between 1 and 24. Combining the fill and vecflak function gives the effect of a heavily defended target with lots of flak guns
as well as a dangerous flak attack that tracks individual targets, although generally speaking the time of flight based flak function is a better
representation of a flak defended area like a city or airfield. The vector based flak function may be more appropriate for representing a defense with
a small amount of heavy flak like a lightly defended area or maritime unit. 
For the movvecflak function there is no zone placed in the ME and instead of a zone name a unit name of a unit on the map is passed in. So in the above vecflak becomes movvecflak and YYYY becomes the unit name. 
So for example the trigger action might be DO movvecflak('blue','Unit #01','high',3) END.

Again just to reinforce that for both cases of the moving flak there is no need to create a moving or normal trigger zone in the ME as the Mist function getUnitsInMovingZones is based on finding the units in
an circular area centered on a moving unit given that the position of the moving unit and radius of the area are known. So to use these functions all that is needed is 
a moving (or static) unit (which was intended as a naval unit but might not be) which is going to be defended by flak and a continuously evaluated trigger which has a condition that the moving unit
is alive and then a trigger action of either DO SCRIPT DO movvecflak('ssss','uuuuuuuuu','kkkk',n) END or DO SCRIPT DO movaddtgt('ssss','uuuuuuuuu','kkkk',n) END,
where 'ssss' is either 'blue' or 'red', 'uuuuuuuuu' is the name of the moving unit as given in the ME and 'kkkk' is either 'high','med' or 'low' and n is an integer.


It should be possible to mix and match the various flak functions on the same zone as suits the mission being built. Ditto that you can mix and match different flak 
functions in the same mission to get what you want to see.

On the explosion strength I found a few unconfirmed sources on the net that gave an 88mm shell a lethal
radius of 30ft or about 10m. I tested using ramp parked AI aircraft and set explosions at 10m until I found a strength that made the pilot bailout. 
This was strength 9.  As the vector scripts are a single burst and wider errors I made them 1 point stronger
