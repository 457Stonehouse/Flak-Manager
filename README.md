# Flak Manager
Flak Manager Script for DCS World

Originally the concept of adding WW2 style flak to DCS World was pioneered by Sithspawn, taking this starting point Stonehouse developed and enhanced the concept to arrive at the current script which simulates barrage style flak, single gun flak, "effect" flak to provide dramatic effect without real danger to the player as well as crew skill, reloading etc. etc.
